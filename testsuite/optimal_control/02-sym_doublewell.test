Test       : Symmetric Double Well
Program    : octopus
TestGroups : long-run, optimal_control
Enabled    : Yes

# The test ensures the optimal control algorithm ZBR98. 
# It calculates the optimal laser field that transfers one particle
# localized in one particle well to other.
#
# [In fact, this test has been modified to transfer the system from
# the ground to the excited state, due to the reason explained in
# file 02-sym_doublewell.03-oct.inp]


# Ground state and unoccupied states
Input: 02-sym_doublewell.01-ground_state.inp
